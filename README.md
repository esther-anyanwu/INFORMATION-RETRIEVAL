# INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL

This project is divided into two main parts:  
# 1. Search Engine:
        The Search engine file (test.ipynb) is created using Beautiful soup to crawl the University of Coventry publication website for authors
        in the School of Economics, Finance and Accounting. The search engine makes use of an Inverted Index and also has a query processor
        This query processor helps search publications from the author in this particular association
# 2. Document Clustering:
        This part works with clustering documents with the use of Kmeans.
        All the newsline are gotten from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/bbc-news?resource=download)
